# ORB (TC) conformal example

This repo captures code and ideas for applying "Conformal Prediction for Simulation Models" to ORB function predictions.

The data and simulation models were provided by Trey McNeely, Ann Lee, Kimberly Wood, Nic Dalmasso and Pavel Khokhlov ([arXiv:1911.11089v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11089), [arXiv:2010.05783v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11089)).
